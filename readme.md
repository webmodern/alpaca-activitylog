# Alpaca Activity Log

This package adds a page to the Filament Admin panel to view the activity log generated by [`spatie/laravel-activitylog`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-activitylog).



## Installation

| Plugin Version | Filament Version | PHP Version |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| 0.1.x          | 4.x              | \> 8.4      |

Install via Composer.

**Requires PHP 8.4 and Filament 4.0**

```bash
composer require webmodern/alpaca-activitylog
```

> **Warning**
> This plugin only offers a page to show activities related to your model. You need [`spatie/laravel-activitylog`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-activitylog) installed and configured for it to work. It is important you are using the `LogsActivity` trait as per [Spatie's docs](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-activitylog/v4/advanced-usage/logging-model-events) for this work as we use the '->activities()' method of the trait.
